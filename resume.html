      <p id="Basketball">
         Basketball is a fun sport to play. It consists of running, dribbling, handling, shooting, 
         and passing. I play for a team called yeaa sports. we have 2 games a week and we have fun.
         We had a All star weekend, and the players won against the coaches. I made it to the 
         second play off game, then we lost 29-33.

         music is the solution to all problems. Music is something weall have in common.

         they have helped me embrce music even more, to a whole new level. The genres of Music
